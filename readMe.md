# CSS-Advanced-3 🎨✨

This is an interactive web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 💡 Functionality

- The user can choose between three different shapes: **circle**, **rectangle**, or **semicircle**.
- By clicking the **Jump!** button, the selected shape performs a jump animation.
- The shape also casts a shadow that moves and scales dynamically during the jump.
- Another button lets the user **show or hide the GitHub repository link** with a typing and deleting effect.

All interactions are handled via **JavaScript DOM manipulation** and enhanced with **CSS animations**, **transitions**, and **transforms**.
